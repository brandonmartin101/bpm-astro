The number of contributors, the total amount raised, campaign details, and highlights? Also consider size, imagery, placement, slogans, etc.`,
	},
	{

		name: '040 - Recipe or Food Order',
		design: '040',
		description: `Design a food related recipe. It could displayed on a tablet while someone is cooking in their home kitchen or in the back of a restaurant on a Kitchen Display System (aka KDS). Clarity is important because a restaurant or online food ordering service needs to be simple in order to be fast for customers to find what they want and how it can be customized. Confusing menus or recipes slow down the kitchen and the entire business.`,
	},
	{
		name: '041 - Workout / Exercise',
		design: '041',
		description: `Create a UI related for monitoring health or tracking various workout/training routines. It could be for a personal workout, for a team, or even gym equipment tracking customer workouts.

	},
	{
		name: '046 - Invoice',
		design: '046',
		description: `Invoices are generally sent for products or services before or after fulfillment. For example, a web designer or software engineer might send an invoice for a new website with 25% as a downpayment and the remainder on completion. This is not a quote or proposal, so it should have only the required information for payment, services rendered, prices, etc. and ideally a link/button to receive payment. Tip: An invoice is a nice opportunity to thank a client. Uplifting comments can put clients in a good mood. If you know them in a personal/friendly context, sometimes a meme can help break the ice on making a payment. :)`,
	},
	{
		name: '047 - Activity Feed',
		design: '047',
		description: `Everyday we're overwhelmed with information. Design an activity feed that's fun and useful. It could be for a news reader app, a social media site, or for inspirational travel content updates.`,

	{
		name: '049 - Notification',
		design: '049',
		description: `Today's challenge is super simple. Just a plain and easy notification. It could be a daily reminder to take medication, a new message received notification, or app updates.`,
	},
	{
		name: '050 - Job Listing or Hiring Page',
		design: '050',
		description: `Who is hiring? What's the position? Where is it located? Are there benefits? Hiring pages are a great opportunity for brands to give fun facts about their team.

	},
	{
		name: '051 - Press Page',
		design: '051',
		description: `Create a Press Page design. Think about who you are representing and what important information you should convey. Is it for a new startup? A huge global brand?

	},
	{
		name: '052 - Logo Design',
		design: '052',
		description: `Will it be animated? In what capacity will it be used? Branding is generally a serious matter for most companies and the considerations for size, placement, color, etc. should be thought out carefully. The biggest brands don't always have the best logos. A great logo is one that compliments a specific purpose and not necessarily a generic image or name. For example, Nike uses a swoosh which shows motion and speed - core parts of their running image. Mailchimp showcases a monkey rather than an “email” icon and it adds depth and character to their brand.`,
	},
	{
		name: '053 - Website Navigation',
		design: '053',
		description: `Most websites have a navbar that's stuffed with links and logos. What could you design that's both functional and appealing? How could you make it unique?`,
